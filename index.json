Let’s dive deep into OAuth 2 with the actual work flow involved in it. Basically there are four roles involved in it. OAuth 2 Roles:- Resource Owner Client Resource Server Authorization Server Resource Owner: User An entity capable of granting the access to the protected resources. It is actually a user who authorize the access to their application. Typically this is an end-user. Client: Application An client is the application which wants to access the user’s account. To access the protected account it must be authorized by user and authorization must be valid with the Authorization server i.e API . Resource/Authorization Server: API Resource Server is hosting the protected resources of certain user where as Authorization Server verify the identity of user and providing the access_token to the application for authorization.

Authorization Request I have taken a new user ‘test’ and request the resource owner qtc user. Authorization Grant By exploiting the contact form user test will grant authorization by user qtc using the code. Authorization Grant Now I am into user qtc and requesting access-token presenting an authorization grant to the authorization server. Access Token Authorization server authenticates the client(application) that I have used and validates the authorization grant, and if valid , issues an access token that to user which will be invalid after 600 sec. Access Token Now client (application) request the protected resources using above access_token and will be authenticated by server. Protected Resources After verifying the access_token and sessionid of that user Resource server will provide the protected resources. Firstly, let’s talk about the basic topic involved in OAuth 2. Authorization Grant Authorization grant is a credentials representing the resource owner’s authorization used by the client to obtain an access token. There are four types of grant:- implicit, authorization code, resource owner password credentials and client credentials. Authorization Code The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner. Instead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code. Client Credentials Client credentials can be used as authorization grant when authorization scope is limited to the protected resources under the control of the client. It is used as authorization grant typically when the client is acting on its own behalf(the client is the resource owner) or requesting to access the protected resources. Access token Access token are the credentials with the combination of strings used to access protected resources. Client Registration Before initiating the protocol, the client registers with the authorization server. The means through which the client registers with the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML registration form. When supported by the authorization server, registration can rely on other means for establishing trust and obtaining the required client properties (e.g., redirection URI, client type). Client Type Basically there are two client type based on their ability to authenticate securely with authorization with authorization server. Confidential Type Here application is capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials or capable of secure client authentication using other means. Public Type Here application is incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials or incapable of secure client authentication using any other means. Redirection URI It redirects the user-agent of service after an authorization code is granted. For e.g I used my local server to see the response from the request I send in a certain field like contact form(vulnerable field) and finally got the sessionid. Below you can see the real work flow involve in Oauth2 and it’s really Oouch… ","date":"2020-03-22","objectID":"/oauth2/:0:2","tags":["oauth2","server"],"title":"OAuth 2","uri":"/oauth2/"},{"categories":["CTF"],"content":"Here I will explain one of the challenge from NepHack 3.0 CTF .","date":"2020-03-07","objectID":"/nephack3/","tags":["linux","nephack3","ctf","binaryexploitation","gdb","pwnables"],"title":"Nephack 3.0","uri":"/nephack3/"},{"categories":["CTF"],"content":"Actually NepHack is one of the Biggest Hacking Competition of Nepal after threatcon which is especially CTF (Jeopardy type) competition which is held annually every year in K.U.( Kathmandu University), Dhulikhel, Nepal.

Among them I had created one of the challenges related to bof and luckily same challenge was in NepHack 3.0 which was of 496 points named Duffer. They have given ssh.log file on root@gr4n173:~$cat ssh.log I got ssh.log. part file there I can see the ssh login attempt log file by different user . I got the credentials from one of the members maskop9 from winning team(me0w) during live event . Credential is hacker/cynical1 with local IP 192.168.10.189. Since IP given was local IP, I wasn’t able to ssh into that user so I had to figure out other ways and I noticed I had a shell from shadow challenge which was of phindrella user and I am going to publish next Writeup where I will explain how I got phindrella user and it’s shell. Then, I tried with that credentials as Fig:-Into hacker shell I am able to login hacker shell and since I was in tty shell I had to spawn that shell so I used root@gr4n173:~$python -c \"\"import pty;pty.spawn(‘/bin/bash’)\" As challenge have given a description about the location at /hom/pax and I got two files. Fig:- hacker_shell one is vuln executable and other is flag.txt which doesn’t have permission to read .Since vuln file is ELF file so I generally read that file with gdb but my bad organizer doesn’t have gdb installed in that shell. So first I have to download that file to my localhost for that I used scp root@gr4n173:~$scp hacker@iZa2dh0wn9s9aolc3csaudZ:/home/pax /root/Downloads/ this way I was able to download to my localhost and I had given the execute permission to that file. root@gr4n173:~$chmod +x vuln I had gdb install so used this command to read vuln file root@gr4n173:~$gdb -q vuln Fig:- vuln run normally nothing happened there and I entered many random text and I got segmented fault. Now, I had to find the offset after which SIGSEGV fault occurred. I mostly use one of my favorite method to find offset as root@root:$ /usr/share/metasploit framework/tools/exploit/./pattern_create.rb -l 100 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A root@root:$ /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/./pattern_offset.rb -q 0x0000555555554830 [*] Exact match at offset 40 This way I got the offset. Then, I had to find the function where flag is located. For that I searched every functions and got this fig:-Functions names there I got fLog() function as noticeable and had to find the address of this function as Fig:- Address of fLog Since that is the address before running the file and after running I got this Fig:-Address of fLog after running file Since all the address should be used in Little Endian format. There is small story about Little Endian if you are interested you can read from here Address is 0x8a4755555555 in Little Endian format and offset = 40 address to call = 8a4755555555 So my final payload was: root@gr4n173:~$python -c “print(‘A’*40 + ‘\\x8a\\x47\\x55\\x55\\x55\\x55’)” | ./vuln Fig:- Flag This way I got the flag as cynical_flag{hacker_kto_mah} and got 495 points. I wanted to thank all readers for being with me through my post and I will be posting other walkthrough of NepHack 3.0 challenges soon. At last, I would like to acknowledge brother @maskop9 for helping through out the competition and other helping hands along with the organizer Cynical Technology for awesome platform seems like they too have bugbounty platform as bugv.io :) ","date":"2020-03-07","objectID":"/nephack3/:3:0","tags":["linux","nephack3","ctf","binaryexploitation","gdb","pwnables"],"title":"Nephack 3.0","uri":"/nephack3/"},{"categories":["hackthebox"],"content":"Here I will explain my path for Scavenger box from Hack The Box.","date":"2020-02-29","objectID":"/scavenger/","tags":["linux","htb","ftp","sqli","RE","lkm","whois","pcap","ffuf","fuzz"],"title":"Scavenger","uri":"/scavenger/"},{"categories":["hackthebox"],"content":"Scavenger box was the hardes after Zetta box.

As root.ko file was ELF file and I love reversing the ELF file so I analyzed using my latest favorite tool ghidra. I opened it using ghidra if you are unfamiliar with ghidra tool you can see more about it here: ghidra. From the analysis of file root.c word magic was in function root_write(). So I checked that function in ghidra and got below as result. There I saw three variables as local_31 local_2d local_28 which was defined already. But these variable was defined in little Indian format. If you are unfamiliar with this format then don’t worry I will explain in my next blog. local_31 = 0x743367; # g3t local_2d = 0x76317250; # Pr1v local_28 = 0x746f3052743067; # g0tR0ot And on analyzing more about that function I got something fishy in snprintf((char *)\u0026local_28,8,\"%s%s\",\u0026local_31,\u0026local_2d);. In the above function from ghidra I found that value of local_28 is replaced with local_31+local_2d. If you are unfamiliar about snprintf function you can visit here snprintf. So my final magic word was g3tPr1v. Using this as above in browser, I got the root.txt file. This way I got the root of scavenger box and learned alot from this box.

After a lot of enumeration I found something fishy in /etc/rsyslog.d/.git where I found pgsql.conf but I wasn’t able to cat that file due to permission error. So I used other ways to read that file. For that I used git command since, there is .git repo in that directory as roy@zetta:/tmp$ cd /etc/rsyslog.d/ roy@zetta:/etc/rsyslog.d$ git clone /etc/rsyslog.d/.git /tmp/.git Cloning into '/tmp/.git'... done. roy@zetta:/etc/rsyslog.d$ ls -al /tmp/.git/ total 16 drwxr-xr-x 3 roy roy 4096 Feb 20 06:21 . drwxrwxrwt 11 root root 4096 Feb 20 06:21 .. drwxr-xr-x 8 roy roy 4096 Feb 20 06:21 .git -rw-r--r-- 1 roy roy 807 Feb 20 06:21 pgsql.conf Now I was able to cat that file and where the file indicates there is sql injection one of the template and gives more information about local logging. Logging was new for me so googled and collected information about it.

Since this box got postgres I googled for latest exploit of postgresql and got COPY FROM PROGRAM Command Execution vulnerability. For more info about it you can click here. And instead of using Metasploit I used the manual ways to exploit this vulnerability for that I used this blog here. On reading blogs to use COPY command user must be superuser only then I can exploit it. For that I changed the user roy to superuser as roy@zetta:~$ logger -p local7.info \"aaa',current_timestamp);ALTER USER roy WITH SUPERUSER; --\" Now I exploit the postgres and able to run the command injection in syslog database. At my first attempt I was interrupted and unable to run command in postgres but after 2nd/3rd attempt I used ($$)Dollar-quoting for escaping single quotes in postgres to exploit command injection.
